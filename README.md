# mars-model
A customer response classification model built using supervised learning to predict outcomes based on market or campaign features.

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at developing a **Market Response System (MRS)** to predict customer responses based on various input features. The project demonstrates classification modeling using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, with a focus on feature processing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `MRS.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code for data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation  
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions  

## 💡 Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas  
- Feature encoding (categorical to numeric)  
- Train-test splitting of dataset  
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.  
- Accuracy scoring and classification report  
- Ready to be expanded for real-world campaign response prediction  

## 🧪 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

## 📊 Applications  
- Predicting customer responses in marketing campaigns  
- Analyzing consumer behavior  
- Optimizing ad targeting or promotional efforts
